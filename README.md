# Headline
Welcome to the repository for the headline app developed by [Aidan Sibley](https://linkedin.com/in/aidansibley)

The deployed project can be found: [here](https://headline.ajsibley.com).

This repo serves to house two submodules that represent the backend and frontend code bases. This project is still under development and is not yet public, this readme page will outline the future plans for the project.

## Stack

The project utilizes the popular MERN stack with the addition of Next.js. Let's call it MERNx. That is:

**FRONT**
- React - (Next.js)
- Material UI (*styling*)
- Vercel (*deployment*)

**BACK**
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Heroku (*deployment*)

## Motivation for the project
I am Aidan, a student at Queen's University in Kingston Ontario Canada. I, *like many folks*, have discontent with the current social media landscape. I am not a huge fan of the current media models that prioritizes views, likes, folllowers, and generally all metrics that trigger primal dopaminergic actions within us. This unhealthy relationship to media, causes unrealistic ideals and by extension counterintuitively narrows our world views. Headline is the solution to the looming exestensial threat posed by the media giants. 

Headline is not meant to be a compeditor in the social media space, rather to carve a novel strategy, where we focus on the real lives of those in our immediate community; a *virtual newspaper* to focus on the local rather than global.
